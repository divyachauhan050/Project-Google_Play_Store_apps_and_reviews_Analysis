# Project-Google_Play_Store_apps_and_reviews_Analysis

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories.It involved data cleaning, correcting data types, exploring app categories, and obtaining a distribution of app ratings. These steps then helped in drawing insights about the app size and app prize, and this relationship was analyzed using jointplots.
